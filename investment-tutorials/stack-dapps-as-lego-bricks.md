# Stack DApps like you would stack Lego bricks

When you farm yields on a given farm, you usually get rewards under the form of native farm tokens. You then have the choice between either selling those, or keep them and hope they will gain some value over time. This guide will present a few different DApps (**D**ecentralized **App**lications) to maximize your yields without selling anything, while still compounding interests. This articles will also start from stable coins, because this is considered as a relatively safe strategy. However, you need to keep in mind that this is not a financial advice, and that this guide should be followed with caution as results are absolutely not guaranteed. As always, do your own research.

## Disclaimer

Everything presented in this strategy assumes the following:

* The different APRs/APYs are stable and remain the same over the span of 1 year \(APRs and APYs will have some variance, and some reward programs are limited to a few weeks\)
* The QUICK, IMX, ADDY and MATIC tokens keep a relatively stable price over the span of 1 year \(very unlikely unlikely\)
* This process requires a relatively high number of transactions whenever you need to compound your rewards. However, all simulations have been made without taking the transaction cost into consideration.
* The simulation doesn't include the possible impermanent losses, and assume you follow the steps for a whole year, regardless of the different price variations of all involved tokens.

Keep in mind that a strategy that works well at a given time may perform poorly \(or make you lose money\) at another time. Please stay informed, monitor the markets, keep an eye on your investments, and as always, do your own research.
