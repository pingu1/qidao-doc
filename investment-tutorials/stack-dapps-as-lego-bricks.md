# Stack DApps like you would stack Lego bricks

When you farm yields on a given farm, you usually get rewards under the form of native farm tokens. You then have the choice between either selling those, or keep them and hope they will gain some value over time. This guide will present a few different DApps (**D**ecentralized **App**lications) to maximize your yields without selling anything, while still compounding interests. This articles will also start from stable coins, because this is considered as a relatively safe strategy. However, you need to keep in mind that this is not a financial advice, and that this guide should be followed with caution as results are absolutely not guaranteed. As always, do your own research.

## QuickSwap

QuickSwap is one of the biggest AMM (**A**utomated **M**arket **M**aker) on Polygon. People deposit pairs of tokens to liquidity pools and earn transaction fees from other users who use the platform to swap their tokens. During a swap, QuickSwap automatically choses the best route using the different liquidity pools, and each jump from one pool to the other is subject to transaction fees that are redistributed to the liquidity suppliers. 

### Stable coin farming

For this exercise, we will use the MAI/USDC pair on QuickSwap. This liquidity pool, a stable pool, proposes an APY (**A**nnual **P**ercentage **Y**ield that varies between 20% and 25%). The yield is composed of the transaction fees (that are accrued into the liquidity pool) and QUICK reward. The pool gets a fix amount of QUICK tokens that are then distributed to liquidity providers according to their share of the pool. As an example, if the pool has the equivalent of $1,000,000 worth of LP (**L**iquidity **P**rovider) tokens and you already deposited $1,000 of LP tokens, you own 0.1% of the pool, which entitles you to 0.1% of the daily QUICK reward.

### Dragon's Lair

The Dragon's Lair is a way to optimize your gains on QuickSwap. You can deposit the QUICK tokens that you earn from liquidity pools into the Lair, and they will earn you additional QUICK rewards. This is a good solution to keep the QUICK tokens instead of selling it on the open market. When you QUICK tokens are staked into the Dragon's Lair, the reward they generate are automatically compounded, and the APY of the Lair is around 12%.

When you claim your QUICK rewards from the liquidity pools, you can deposit it into the Lair where they will be added to your existing rewards as well as the one granted by the Lair itself. After you deposited your QUICK tokens, you will get in your wallet some dQUICK tokens, that represent the share of the QUICK pool that you own. Note that the ratio QUICK:dQUICK isn't 1:1 since the dQUICK represent your share of the pool, while the amount of QUICK will increase over time as more rewards are added to the pool.

### Dragon's Syrup

The Dragon's Syrup is an additional way that QuickSwap offers to the dQUICK holders. Indeed, partners of QuickSwap will grant

## Disclaimer

Everything presented in this strategy assumes the following:

* The different APRs/APYs are stable and remain the same over the span of 1 year \(APRs and APYs will have some variance, and some reward programs are limited to a few weeks\)
* The QUICK, IMX, ADDY and MATIC tokens keep a relatively stable price over the span of 1 year \(very unlikely unlikely\)
* This process requires a relatively high number of transactions whenever you need to compound your rewards. However, all simulations have been made without taking the transaction cost into consideration.
* The simulation doesn't include the possible impermanent losses, and assume you follow the steps for a whole year, regardless of the different price variations of all involved tokens.
