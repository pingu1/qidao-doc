# DCA em mercados de alta e baixa

## Introdução

"Tempo no mercado é muito melhor do que cronometrar o mercado" é algo que você certamente já ouviu. Na verdade, ninguém pode perfeitamente vender no topo ou comprar no fundo. É por isso que a maioria dos investidores usará o DCA (Dollar Cost Average) para acumular o ativo que mais deseja. O DCA consiste em comprar uma pequena quantidade com uma determinada frequência, independentemente do preço. Ao fazer isso, o preço médio de compra é reduzido e você tem mais chances de comprar mais de um determinado ativo em comparação com uma única compra feita na hora errada.

Você pode encontrar mais detalhes sobre o que é Dollar-Cost Averaging no site da [investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp), que dá esta definição:

> Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) é uma estratégia de investimento na qual um investidor divide o valor total a ser investido em compras periódicas de um ativo-alvo em um esforço para reduzir o impacto da volatilidade na compra geral. As compras ocorrem independentemente do preço do ativo e em intervalos regulares.

Este artigo explica como você pode fazer DCA corretamente em seus ativos favoritos para completar seus vaults no Mai Finance, mas você também pode fazer DCA com a stablecoin MAI para obter um preço de venda melhor.

## Entendendo o Dollar Cost Averaging

Vamos ver como você pode fazer DCA em diferentes condições de mercado e o que isso significa em termos de poder de compra/venda.

### DCA em tendência de baixa (mercado baixista)

Quando o mercado já estiver em baixa por bastante tempo e (assim esperamos) perto do fundo, ou pelo menos em um nível de preço que você se sinta confortável para comprar, esse é o momento de acumular seus ativos favoritos e comprar tokens. Porque, é claro, você quer comprar quando o preço estiver baixo para vender quando estiver alto. E aqui temos um exemplo real do preço de ETH na primeira metade de junho de 2022:

| Data     | Preço de ETH em USD |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| 06/01/22 | 1,928.60            |
| 06/02/22 | 1,814.00            |
| 06/03/22 | 1,826.39            |
| 06/04/22 | 1,751.69            |
| 06/05/22 | 1,791.55            |
| 06/06/22 | 1,876.70            |
| 06/07/22 | 1,756.89            |
| 06/08/22 | 1,776.58            |
| 06/09/22 | 1,798.50            |
| 06/10/22 | 1,791.43            |
| 06/11/22 | 1,668.25            |
| 06/12/22 | 1,467.21            |
| 06/13/22 | 1,349.25            |
| 06/14/22 | 1,170.75            |
| 06/15/22 | 1,169.67            |

Esta é uma queda no preço de 39,35% para a primeira quinzena de junho, que antecedeu um mês desastroso de maio. Agora, supondo que você comprou um pouco de ETH todos os dias durante o mesmo período de tempo, este é o preço médio pelo qual você teria comprado ETH:

| Date     | average DCA price |
| -------- | ----------------- |
| 06/01/22 | 1,928.60          |
| 06/02/22 | 1,871.30          |
| 06/03/22 | 1,856.33          |
| 06/04/22 | 1,830.17          |
| 06/05/22 | 1,822.45          |
| 06/06/22 | 1,831.49          |
| 06/07/22 | 1,820.83          |
| 06/08/22 | 1,815.30          |
| 06/09/22 | 1,813.43          |
| 06/10/22 | 1,811.23          |
| 06/11/22 | 1,798.23          |
| 06/12/22 | 1,770.65          |
| 06/13/22 | 1,738.23          |
| 06/14/22 | 1,697.70          |
| 06/15/22 | 1,662.50          |

Com preço médio de US$ 1.662,50 e preço final de US$ 1.169,67, a queda passa de mais de 39% para 29,64%. Nesse sentido, o DCA reduz suas perdas. Isso também significa que, para equilibrar, você precisa que o preço volte para US$ 1.662,50 em vez de US$ 1.928,60, e caso o preço volte para US$ 1.928,60, você teria um lucro de 16%.

![Preço real de ETH vs preço de ETH + DCA](../../.gitbook/assets/dca-1.png)

An interesting thing to note is that if you sold your ETH for USDC (or another stable coin like MAI) over the same period, your average selling price would also have been $1,662.50, and you would have sold at a better price every day except for the 6th of June. This once again proves that DCA is way better than trying to time the market.

### DCA in an uptrend (bullish market)

When the market is going up, you may also want to DCA into specific assets to pull the average purchase price down while the price is going up. Obviously, you want to do that at the beginning of the mark-up period of the main market cycle, which is why it's strongly recommended to DCA even in an uptrend. As an example, here's the ETH price for the first 15 days of October 2021.

| Date     | ETH price in USD |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| 10/01/21 | 3,001.13         |
| 10/02/21 | 3,308.87         |
| 10/03/21 | 3,390.77         |
| 10/04/21 | 3,418.78         |
| 10/05/21 | 3,381.78         |
| 10/06/21 | 3,516.57         |
| 10/07/21 | 3,576.81         |
| 10/08/21 | 3,587.83         |
| 10/09/21 | 3,560.00         |
| 10/10/21 | 3,575.02         |
| 10/11/21 | 3,419.73         |
| 10/12/21 | 3,546.48         |
| 10/13/21 | 3,492.75         |
| 10/14/21 | 3,604.96         |
| 10/15/21 | 3,790.15         |

This is more or less the opposite of the previous section where the price of ETH jumped by +26.29% in 15 days. So if you were lucky and bought on the 1st of October, that's the profit you would have realized by selling on the 15th. Instead, if you had invested every day for the period, here is the average price at which you would have bought ETH:

| Date     | ETH price in USD |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| 10/01/21 | 3,001.13         |
| 10/02/21 | 3,155.00         |
| 10/03/21 | 3,233.59         |
| 10/04/21 | 3,279.89         |
| 10/05/21 | 3,300.27         |
| 10/06/21 | 3,336.32         |
| 10/07/21 | 3,370.67         |
| 10/08/21 | 3,397.82         |
| 10/09/21 | 3,415.84         |
| 10/10/21 | 3,431.76         |
| 10/11/21 | 3,430.66         |
| 10/12/21 | 3,440.31         |
| 10/13/21 | 3,444.35         |
| 10/14/21 | 3,455.82         |
| 10/15/21 | 3,478.11         |

With an average price of $3,478.11 and an ending price of $3,790.15, you would make a gain of 15.89% by selling on the 15th. In this case, the DCA price is always lower than the market price, except on the 11th of October, which means that you would always be able to sell the asset you purchased with a benefit.

![Actual ETH price VS DCA'd ETH price](../../.gitbook/assets/dca-2.png)

In this situation, you can also DCA into stablecoins using your Ether. With an average sell price of $3,478.11, you would make a better profit than spot selling in the first 5 days or on the 11th. This is particularly good if you want to capture benefits, repay a loan, or accumulate stablecoins for the next time the market goes down. You may also want to "save" high prices into stablecoins in order to farm yields in uncertain times where your volatile assets have a risk to go down.

### DCA'ing during market cycle

Whether you are investing in crypto-currencies or the stock market, you probably noticed that markets are cyclical. Once again, you can read more about market cycles in the [investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/market-cycles-key-maximum-returns/), but here are the key things you need to know:

* Markets move in four phases; understanding how each phase works and how to benefit is the difference between floundering and flourishing.
* In the accumulation phase, the market has bottomed, and early adopters and contrarians see an opportunity to jump in and scoop up discounts.
* In the mark-up phase, the market seems to have leveled out, and the early majority are jumping back in, while the smart money is cashing out.
* In the distribution phase, sentiment turns mixed to slightly bearish, prices are choppy, sellers prevail, and the end of the rally is near.
* In the mark-down phase, laggards try to sell and salvage what they can, while early adopters look for signs of a bottom so they can get back in.

Inflection points are the moment when you need to switch from a buyer to a seller in your DCA strategy:

## DCA into volatile assets using Mai Finance and Mean Finance

### Mai Finance

[Mai Finance](https://app.mai.finance) is a lending protocol where you will be able to deposit particular assets as collateral and borrow the MAI stablecoin at 0% interest. For this particular guide, let's assume we want to DCA into ETH from an existing portfolio already containing the equivalent of $1,000 worth of ETH. On the decentralized application, you will be able to

* deposit the ETH into an ETH vault
* borrow MAI against your collateral

In order to limit the risks, we will assume that you borrow $300 worth of MAI to keep a healthy CDR (**C**ollateral to **D**ebt **R**atio).

### Mean Finance

[Mean Finance](https://mean.finance/) is an automated application where you will be able to set up a DCA position that will automatically purchase specific assets using other assets, with a given frequency over a given amount of time.

![Creating a DCA position on Mean finance](../../.gitbook/assets/dca-4.png)

Once created, you will be able to see the performance of your DCA position as well as the history of all the swaps.

![DCA performance over time](../../.gitbook/assets/dca-5.png)

As you can see above, the DCA strategy is currently buying ETH every 4 hours and buying 1.61 MAI worth of ETH. A higher frequency will reflect the volatility of the targetted asset more than a less frequent swap.

It's important to note a few things about Mean Finance

* Positions are NFTs, meaning that you are the only one with access to the position.
* Because it's an NFT, you can possibly transfer the ownership to another address.
* You can withdraw the asset already swapped at any given moment. This is particularly useful if the average price is way lower than the current market price and you want to sell what you already converted.
* You can update the duration and rate of the DCA strategy as you wish. This is once again particularly useful if you can withdraw and sell the swapped asset with a substantial profit and re-invest into your DCA position.
* You can terminate the position at any moment and withdraw both the swapped asset as well as the collateral used to make purchases.

### DCA Strategy

The strategy for this guide is more or less what has been explained in the sections above.

![DCA back and forth using Mai.Finance and Mean.Finance](../../.gitbook/assets/dca-6.png)

Assuming you want to accumulate Ether, you will have to

* You can zap your ETH into the camWETH vault on Mai Finance in order to collect rewards from AAVE v2 lending market
* Borrow MAI to keep a healthy CDR
* Feed your MAI in Mean Finance for a given period of time
* At the end of the DCA period collect your WETH
* Repeat by topping off your vault

The idea here is that you may be able to borrow more or less MAI every time you renew your DCA position, depending on the market price and the health factor of your vault on Mai Finance. This strategy will allow you to slowly accumulate Ether using a DCA approach instead of leveraging everything at once. Topping off your vault is also a good way to keep a healthy CDR.

If you prefer selling your Ether, you can do the opposite loop and DCA into stable coins to repay your loan on Mai Finance:

* Feed WETH into Mean Finance for a given period of time and DCA out for MAI
* At the end of the DCA period, collect your MAI
* Repay your loan from Mai Finance
* Zap out your camWETH tokens from the vault and collect WETH
* Repeat by selling more WETH via Mean Finance

If you're doing this correctly, you will normally be able to fully repay your loan and end up with more Ether than what you originally deposited.

Alternatively, you can use the MAI loan to farm yields, and convert the rewards to a stablecoin that will be used to feed the DCA engine from Mean Finance.

## Disclaimer

Everything presented in this tutorial is educational content made to illustrate how you can use Dollar Cost Average to average the price of volatile assets and hopefully accumulate them in a sustainable manner. The goal here is to build wealth over a long period of time using automated tools rather than buying and selling with your feelings.

This strategy also presents some risks if you don't analyze the entire market. Indeed, if you start buying at the top of the cycle, DCA'ing will obviously not work that well and will take a lot of time before the average purchase price reaches an adequate market price. And your vault may be at risk if you use all your loan to DCA into a volatile asset while the market is at the beginning of a downtrend. As always, make sure you understand properly where the market is going before investing.
